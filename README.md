# UnityProjects
This is a repo for games/projects I made in unity. Here are the browser-runnable webgl builds of my projects:
# [Anagrams](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/Anagrams/build/webgl/index.html)
![](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/Anagrams/screenshots/anagramsScreenshot.PNG)
Type words using the letters shown and press enter to submit each word. You can only use one of each letter and you can only earn points for a word once. It also has to be a real word. You have one minute to enter as many words as possible, and score depends on the length of the word.
# [Asteroids](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/Asteroids/Build/webgl/index.html)
The classic arcade game asteroids. Use A and D to rotate, W to move forward, and left click to shoot
