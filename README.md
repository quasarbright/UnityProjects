# UnityProjects
This is a repo for games/projects I made in unity. Here are the browser-runnable webgl builds of my projects:

# [UpDown](https://quasarbright.github.io/UpDownPages/)  
UpDown is a 2D puzzle platformer video game based on switching the direction of gravity. I made it with two other students in a game design course as our final project. The code is private since it was for a school project.

# [Anagrams](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/Anagrams/build/webgl/index.html)

Type words using the letters shown and press enter to submit each word. You can only use one of each letter and you can only earn points for a word once. It also has to be a real word. You have one minute to enter as many words as possible, and score depends on the length of the word.

# [Asteroids](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/Asteroids/Build/webgl/index.html)
![](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/Asteroids/screenshots/asteroid%20screenshots.PNG)
The classic arcade game asteroids. Use A and D to rotate, W to move forward, and left click to shoot  

# [Poppy Seeds](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/PoppySeeds/Build/webgl/index.html)

Random colors moving around using perlin noise

# [Procedural Runner](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/ProceduralRunner/Build/Webgl/index.html)

Press space to fly up and release to fall down. Try not to hit the floor or ceiling. Sometimes it can take a few tries to get going because you might spawn in the ceiling or floor

# [Smart Rockets](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/SmartRockets/Build/index.html)
![](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/SmartRockets/screenshots/Capture.PNG)
This is a Unity 3D version of a [p5.js program I made](https://editor.p5js.org/mdelmonaco/present/BkJquZ1Ae)  

The population of cones learns to seek the target using a genetic algorithm

# [Perlin Cube Terrain](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/Perlin%20Cube%20Terrain/Build/webgl/index.html)
![](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/Perlin%20Cube%20Terrain/screenshots/Capture.PNG)
This is a Unity 3D version of a [processing sketch I made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ozs9ZBzMyw)  

I created a 3D perlin noise scalar field and put green cubes where the value was above a threshold. I then translated the scalar field vertically over time to have the terrain move

# [Genetic Steering](https://quasarbright.github.io/UnityProjects/projects/GeneticSteering/Build/webgl/index.html)

This is a Unity 3D version of a [p5.js sketch I made](https://editor.p5js.org/mdelmonaco/present/HJpO5IJ7Z)  

Cones need to eat green food to survive and die when they eat poison. Each cone has a radius which they could see food and one for poison. They also have a strength for attracting and repelling from food and poison, and a maximum velocity. These parameters are initally randomized, and as the cones reproduce, they are optimized with a genetic algorithm.
